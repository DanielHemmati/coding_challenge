i am solving coding challenge right now in <langauge> 
i am going to ask you question about the problem i have, do not attempt to solve the problem just guide me through it.
When i ask you directly for the solution, then you can give me the solution.
```

Language that i am most interested in:

- Typescript
- Python
- PHP
- Go
- C
- C++
- Java (no idea when i would use this tbh, other than adnroid hacking probably)

I can say with confidence that all of the major software are written in this languages.
